# NHL-Arenas
Here is my final project for GHY 4818 - Web Mapping. 

For my final project, I decided to cover the recent NHL news of the Arizona Coyotes relocating to Salt Lake City, Utah. My aim was to use some of our teachings earlier this year on proportional symbol maps to highlight all 32 arenas of all current teams, including the Delta Center where the Utah team will play in now until it's safe to make a permanent arena. 

This project contains 2 assets datapacks, one being the ec.geojson and the other, wc.geojson. These 2 geojson's provide the information of the 16 teams in the EC (eastern conference) and WC (western conference), such as team name, arena, lat, long, and rough estimates of stadium capacity. Using these geojsons, I could split up each conference and help identify each conference by using different colors for each symbol geojson. This meant all blues would be EC, and all red is WC. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Hockey_League_arenas: This is the website I used to find the data used in the geojson's listed above.

https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/39940303/nhl-arizona-coyotes-move-utah-new-name-schedule-players-coaches: This is the web article I used in my project proposal to figure out what I wanted to do. This showed some of the comparisons Utah has with the hockey world and the differences between Utah and Arizona, regarding the team and what will happen to those members.
